# Unmount Content

When the collapse panel is closed, its contents are still rendered in the DOM. If you need to unmount its content, use the `mountChildren` property to control when the content should be mounted.

```js
function Collapse() {
  const {getCollapseProps, getToggleProps, isOpen, mountChildren} = useCollapse(
    {
      defaultOpen: true,

            going up to the law school, or down to the Sorbonne. The Boulevard
            was busy with trams and people going to work.

      </div>
    </React.Fragment>
  );
}
```
